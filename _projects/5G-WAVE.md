title: "5G-WAVE: A Core Network Framework with Decentralized Authorization for Network Slices"
collection: "projects"
# date: May 2022 - Jun 2023
excerpt: "Designed and implemented a decentralized authorization framework for the 5G core service access among VNFs by utilizing WAVE to eliminate the security vulnerabilities caused by a central OAuth2.0 authorization server.

Deployed the 5G-WAVE platform on a Kubernetes cluster with OpenAirInterface (OAI) entities as 5G VNFs.
Modified the design to offload authorization among VNFs onto side-car proxies (SCPs) which enable service
access by creation and verification of WAVE attestations.

Measured time cost based performance of service operations in 5G-WAVE in network slice deployments to
analyze latency overhead and scalability of the design with multiple slices."
